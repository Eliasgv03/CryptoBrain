# CryptoBrain

CryptoBrain is a web application built with Django that analyzes and displays cryptocurrency data, with an initial focus on Bitcoin. The application provides a dashboard with the current price, historical data, relevant news, and a market analysis generated by an AI agent.

## Technical Analysis

The project stands out for its use of modern software patterns to achieve high performance and maintainability:

-   **Asynchronous Programming**: It uses `async` / `await` in all Django views (`views.py`) and data fetching functions (`fetchers.py`). This allows handling multiple requests to external APIs (prices, news) concurrently without blocking the server's main thread, drastically improving the application's speed and responsiveness.

-   **Functional Programming**: It employs **list comprehensions** for declarative and concise data processing. This approach, inspired by functional programming, results in cleaner and more readable code, especially noticeable when manipulating price and news lists.

## Local Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9 or higher
-   Git

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd CryptoBrain
```

### 3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is a good practice to isolate project dependencies.

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install all the necessary libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

The project requires API keys to function. Create a file named `.env` in the project root (at the same level as `manage.py`).

Copy the following content into your `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your own API keys:

```
# API key for the CryptoPanic news service
CRYPTOPANIC_API_KEY="YOUR_CRYPTOPANIC_API_KEY"

# API key for the Google Gemini AI model
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

### 6. Apply Database Migrations

This command will create the `db.sqlite3` database file and set up the necessary schema.

```bash
python cryptobrain/manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Run the Development Server

You're all set! Start the Django development server.

```bash
python cryptobrain/manage.py runserver
```

The application will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).
