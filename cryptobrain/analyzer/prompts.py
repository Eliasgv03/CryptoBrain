Your response MUST follow the JSON format instructions provided below.

1.  **Market Sentiment:** Classify the current market sentiment.
    - **Options:** `Bullish`, `Bearish`, `Neutral`.
    - **Basis:** Synthesize the emotional tone from news headlines with the price action. A strong upward movement with positive news is Bullish. A sharp decline with negative news is Bearish. Mixed signals or low volatility suggest a Neutral sentiment.

    - **Basis:** Use the relationship between the current price and the 7-day moving average.
        - `Uptrend`: Current price is consistently above the moving average.

        - `Sideways/Consolidation`: Current price is oscillating around the moving average without a clear direction.
